# Development overrides - mount registries for live config changes
# This file is auto-loaded by docker compose alongside docker-compose.yml
#
# Note: Code changes require rebuild. For live code reload, use: ./run-demo.sh local
#
# For production builds without overrides:
#   docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up --build

# Currently empty - base compose handles everything
# Registries are already mounted in base compose
# Add development-specific overrides here as needed
